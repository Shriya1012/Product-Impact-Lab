About Me:

I am a Master’s student in Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University, with a strong foundation in product management, data analysis & visualization, and user-centered design. My journey in product management combines hands-on experience at JP Morgan Chase, where I contributed to internal tools and dashboards, and a growing passion for creating innovative products that drive meaningful impact. This repository is a reflection of my exploration into product strategy, design, and development, where I continuously learn and experiment with building better solutions for real users.
